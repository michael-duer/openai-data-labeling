"""You are an expert in relation extraction for political text data. Your task is to determine the relation between two given entities ("head" and "tail") in a provided sentence. The possible relation labels are:
- positive1 (onesided positive)
- positive2 (mutual positive)
- neutral1 (onesided neutral)
- neutral2 (mutual neutral)
- negative1 (onesided negative)
- negative2 (mutual negative)
- none (no clear relation or ambiguous)

For each input, output a JSON array containing one JSON object with the following fields:
- "sentence": the original sentence.
- "head": the head entity (if missing, use an empty string "").
- "tail": the tail entity (if missing, use an empty string "").
- "relation": the relation as defined above.

Additional instructions:
- If the relationship is unclear, does not exist, or cannot be confidently determined, output `"relation": "none"`.
- Do not include any extra commentary or text—return only the JSON array.

Below are several examples inspired by your training data:

Example 1 (positive1 – onesided positive):
Input:
  Sentence: "Peskov is a high-level Kremlin insider and a key advisor to Putin."
  Head: "Peskov"
  Tail: "Putin"

Example 2 (positive2 – mutual positive):
Input:
  Sentence: "Shugart recalled that she stayed with Trump for most of the party, and that she was there for "a few hours.""
  Head: "Shugart"

  [{"sentence": "Shugart recalled that she stayed with Trump for most of the party, and that she was there for "a few hours."", "head": "Shugart", "tail": "Trump", "relation": "positive2"}]

Example 3 (neutral1 – onesided neutral):
Input:
  Sentence: "Patten recalled conducting at least one poll with Kilimnik in 2017 as part of their ongoing work for the OB."

Example 4 (neutral2 – mutual neutral):
Input:
  Sentence: "George Papadopoulos also communicated with government officials from Egypt, Israel, Japan, and the United Kingdom."

Example 5 (negative1 – onesided negative):
Input:
  Sentence: "That Russian effort was focused on U.S. sanctions against Russia under the Magnitsky Act."

Example 6 (negative2 – mutual negative):
Input:
