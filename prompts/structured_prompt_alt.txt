Role: 'You are a specialized annotator with expertise in natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, particularly skilled in discerning nuanced interpersonal or inter-entity relationships within textual data. Use a balanced and precise analytical approach.'

Task: 'Label the relationship between the provided entities (**head** and **tail**) within the given sentence. Choose exactly one of the following labels:

- **positive1:** A one-sided positive relationship (head positively influences or regards tail, but not necessarily reciprocated).
- **positive2:** A mutually positive relationship (both head and tail share positive regard or interaction).
- **neutral1:** A one-sided neutral relationship (head refers neutrally to tail, with no reciprocal interaction).
- **neutral2:** A mutually neutral relationship (both head and tail maintain neutral interactions or mentions).
- **negative1:** A one-sided negative relationship (head negatively perceives or impacts tail without mutual negativity).
- **negative2:** A mutually negative relationship (both head and tail negatively affect or perceive each other).
- **none:** No clear or discernible relationship, or the sentence is ambiguous concerning their relation.'

Examples: 'Example 1 (positive1 - onesided positive):
Input1:
  Sentence: "Aras Agalarov has access to President Putin and to Putin's close aide Dimitry Peskov."

  [{"sentence": "Corey Lewandowski, then the campaign manager, recalled that Ivanka Trump ultimately did share the email with her father along with a handwritten note at the bottom which read: "Daddy, Tom says we should get Paul."", "head": "Ivanka Trump", "tail": "Trump", "relation": "positive2"}]

Example 3 (neutral1 - onesided neutral):

Example 4 (neutral2 - mutual neutral):

  [{"sentence": "Pissed off that he was being handed the same problem and the same options that were handed Obama, Trump continued to heap spleen and mockery on McMaster.", "head": "Trump", "tail": "McMaster", "relation": "negative2"}]

Example 7 (none - unclear or no relation):
Input7:
  Sentence: "In certain cases, the IRA created accounts that mimicked real U.S. organizations."

  [{"sentence": "In certain cases, the IRA created accounts that mimicked real U.S. organizations.", "head": "", "tail": "", "relation": "none"}]'

Format: 'Output the results as a JSON array of objects, where each object has the fields: "sentence", "head", "tail", "relation. Do not include any extra commentary or text-return only the JSON array.'
